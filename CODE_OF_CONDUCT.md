## Categories of Conduct

## Overall Conduct

This section defines how each class member should and should not act while participating in a computer science course. Everyone is required to adhere to not only this section, but also the following eight sections of this Code of Conduct. Most important in this section is that members respect their peers, regardless of race or gender, as learners. This is a course in which individuals have different skillsets and different levels of mastery in those skills, and disrespecting or shunning a class member for lack of knowledge violates this Code of Conduct. Viewing and using other people's work is a core part of learning how to learn and code effectively, yet when used irresponsibly (such as directly copying another peer's work without their permission or without crediting them) such code will negatively impact learning success. Therefore, members of this course should adhere to the college's honor code for all submitted work.

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - Show respect for all peers as learners and team members
    - Allow peers to voice their opinions and questions
    - Read, understand, and adhere to all parts of this Code of Conduct
    - Follow the college's honor code on all submitted work
    - Come prepared to class everyday
    - Pay attention to the lecturer or presenter when being presented to
    - Show respect to the instructor through paying attention during class and participating during class

- Unacceptable Conduct (U):

  - Members shall not

    - Disrespect peers because of their race or gender
    - Prevent peers from voicing their opinions and questions
    - Violate any part of this Code of Conduct
    - Violate the college's honor code in regards to all submitted work
    - Navigate to other websites or programs unrelated to class materials
    - Directly copy another peer's work without crediting them
    - Inhibit or otherwise hinder the progress of any peer's work

### Attendance

Students are expected to attend class sessions and laboratory sessions in person and remotely depending on what attendance group they were assigned at the start of the semester. In addition to that and due to the nature of the course students should also be expected to communicate and work collaboratively outside of class with team members on a laboratory or project assignment. There are exceptions to this rule that take into account emergencies and illnesses.

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - Ask questions if they are unsure of what they need to do or how to do it

## Team Work

Some of the class activities and lab projects will require team collaboration. This section of the Code of Conduct will provide guidance on effective and inclusive team work.

### Participation

Every class member needs to be actively and cooperatively involved with the class activities and lab projects at hand. This will ensure the flow of questions, ideas, and thoughts in a respectful manner. Our learning environment at its root includes participation, candidness and insightful collaboration. Participating in team-based project discussion means engaging in conversation, not just answering questions. The goal here is to show up and truly be all there.

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - Respond quickly in Slack to clarify confusing issues or assist other colleagues
    - Value and consider everyone's opinion
    - Be willing to meetup and work outside of class

    - Approach issues and team members with professionalism
    - Demonstrate continuous engagement with tasks
    - Be open minded

    - Discriminate against team members based on race, class year, gender, or level of knowledge
    - Abuse the notification / ping system in Slack and expect responses at unreasonable hours of the day, or otherwise expect involvement from members that are not available

### Decisions

The majority of individuals in a team should agree on a given decision before the project is implemented. It should be made with supporting evidence that shows that the decision is productive. When unsure about making a decision it is a good idea to defer to a technical leader or the professor. One should reach out to other teams whom the choice will influence. Teams will determine how long a decision will take to implement.

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - Take into account everyone's input in the decision making process
    - Stay flexible and be willing to change if productive
    - Report errors or bugs to the appropriate team members

    - Defer to the Professor or student technical leaders when unsure about tasks or implementation
    - Distribute tasks to all team members evenly
    - Make new decisions when a previous decision cannot be implemented
    - Use Github issue tracker when a choice is disputed and let team members share their opinion
    - Use efficient communication within and outside of teams

- Unacceptable Conduct (U):

  - Members shall not

    - Let an individual team member or a project manager make major decisions
    - Make decisions without finding evidence showing that it would likely be beneficial
    - Directly contradict a team decision
    - Refuse to work on the decided option
    - Make decisions that would affect another team without first notifying them
    - Refuse to actively participate in group discussions to reach an optimal final decision
    - Refuse to use the issue tracker to discuss a disagreement
    - Interfere in matters or responsibilities that they were not designated to handle
    - Deploy any kind of decision that against codes of ethic

### Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of the project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was successful and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also provide great insight in how to improve in future projects.

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - Work as a team to create a postmortem plan to review and fix sections of the project
    - Develop different approaches to solve issues with the project
    - Provide constructive feedback and propose solutions for issues faced
    - Receive feedback and discuss how it could be used to improve future projects and assignments
    - Communicate and think practically/realistically on ways to improve the program based on efficiency and the skills we have learned throughout the course and at Allegheny
    - Account for situational factors that may come up with remote work when giving feedback and discussing solutions
    - Keep postmortems blameless to increase the accountability in a group and to prevent team members from being blamed
    - Respect that all decisions coming from the results of a postmortem should be arrived through a democratic process based on a majority support from group members

  - Members shall not

    - Insult others while presenting criticism
    - Blame other members for any issues with the final product
    - Refuse to collaborate in fixing remaining issues while a project or lab has not been completed
    - Make fun of other people's solutions
    - Take all credit for all of the team members work that the individual did not do and blame others for everything wrong
    - Target a specific team member when discussing a postmortem or the remaining bugs in a laboratory or project assignment
    - Decide what to do after a postmortem that the majority of the project or laboratory group doesn't agree with
    - Claim that one subjective way of achieving a solution is the only correct way of working towards it

### Conflicts

It is inevitable that conflicts will arise when working as a large group. It is essential, however, to resolve these conflicts in a professional manner while keeping in mind the concerns of everyone involved.

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - Resolve conflicts before they become severe by engaging in respectful conversations
    - Communicate with project managers, if conflicts become severe between class members, who will work to resolve any issues
    - Project managers, technical leaders and the course instructor are responsible for resolving any issues by proposing solutions to reach a compromise between class members involved
    - Project managers may reassign different tasks to group members to solve a conflict
    - Give the course instructor final say in how severe conflicts should be resolved
    - Be respectful and open-minded with everybody in the team when encountering a conflict
    - Report conflict involving violence to the instructors and Dean of Students
    - Be considerate and listen to everyone in the group carefully before determining a suitable solution for the issue

    - Disregard or refuse to resolve an existing conflict that has been brought to their attention
    - Harass others with discriminatory jokes and languages
    - Hold grudges against others for previous conflicts
    - Hide conflicts within a group to prevent interventions to mitigate problems
    - Physically injure others or try or attack members in order to resolve conflicts

## Infractions

An infraction occurs when class member(s) violate the agreed rules present in the Code of Conduct. Any action that is considered "Unacceptable" will cause an infraction. Class member(s) should avoid infractions since the accumulation of them would cause penalties and hinder the progress of the project.

The severity of the infraction is determined by the number of previous infractions. Higher number of past infractions would cause a higher level infraction and thus a more severe penalty.

This guideline for infractions is separate from the Allegheny College Honor Code guidelines. While the Honor Code involves all students in Allegheny College and is enforced by the college's Honor Committee, this Code of Conduct only includes members of the computer science class.

- _Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:_

- Level I: Any violation of a Code of Conduct rule is by default a Level I infraction. Technical leaders and instructor will be keeping track of infractions.

  - Warning to the student not to repeat their behavior
  - The offending student must commit to working towards amending the infraction and avoiding future infractions.

- Level II: Upon the accumulation of three level I infractions, project managers and the instructor will issue a formal level II infraction.

  - Student must formally apologize to the affected party.

  - Student is required to communicate with the professor to discuss continued participation in class.

  - Student may receive a reduced or failing grade for the affected project.

- Level III A Level III infraction will be given to an individual who has accumulated five Level I infractions.

  - Student is required to communicate weekly with the professor to discuss continued participation in class.
  - Depending on the severity of the infraction, student may receive a failing grade for the project and/or class, at the discretion of the professor.

Class member(s) are encouraged to report any infractions in order to ensure a safe, inclusive and collegiate environment.

Class member(s) may appeal any infraction to the instructor of the class. Any decision made by the instructor for the given infraction(s) will be final.
